This is the repository where we are going to learn bash and would like to automate our project

#### Also I'll give name 00 ,01,02,03, to indicate the squence to learn


#### Few of the git commands that we would use  during our upcoming journey

    1)  git clone repo name          : Download the whole repository
    2)  git pull                     : Download only the changes
    3)  git add filename             : git will start tracking the you;re making on the file names filename
    4)  git coming -m "massage name" : Adding MSG to the commit/changes that youmade
    5)  git push                     : your changes will be pushed to the repo
